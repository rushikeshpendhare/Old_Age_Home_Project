This repository contains a fully responsive and modern Old Age Home website built with ReactJS. The project features an elegant user interface, easy navigation across Home, About Us, Services, Gallery, Admission, Survey, and Contact pages, and showcases detailed information for residents and families.

The site uses Material UI and Framer Motion for a polished, interactive look, with adaptive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Forms are included for admissions and feedback, and the gallery provides a visual showcase of facilities and events. Designed for real-world use, this project is an ideal reference for learning ReactJS in modern web development.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
