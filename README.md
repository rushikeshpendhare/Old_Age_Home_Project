This is a complete Old Age Home website built with ReactJS, designed to provide clear, informative, and welcoming access to all key services for senior residents and their families. The site features dedicated pages for Home, About Us, Services, Gallery, Admission, Survey, and Contact, allowing users to explore facilities, staff, activities, and resident care options with ease.

It uses Material UI for a clean and intuitive interface, along with Framer Motion for smooth animations. The responsive layout ensures that every page displays perfectly on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. Visitors can browse an interactive gallery, fill out online admission and contact forms, and read about holistic facilities, health programs, and daily events.

Driven by modern web development best practices, this project is ideal as a learning or portfolio resource for anyone exploring ReactJS, responsive design, and UI/UX for real-world applications. All code is modular and easily extendable for future needs.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
